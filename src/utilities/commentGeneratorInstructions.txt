This project is a monorepo for a responsive ecommerce website based on nextjs 14 and PayloadCMS named thankly.

Key points about the project:
1. We use TypeScript for type safety.

2. The app follows a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns. Components are organized into folders based on their functionality (e.g., _blocks, _components, _providers).
- the frontend code is located in /src/app/(app)
- frontend code is further organised into components, blocks, css, icons, providers, queries and (pages)
- the CMS code for PayloadCMS and the content schema is located in /src/app/(payload)

3. We use nextjs 14 for the user frontend as well as the content management system (CMS). The CMS is based on PayloadCMS and data is written to a postgresql database. We use CI/CD to commit to Github which then triggers a build & deploy on Vercel.

4. We use Payload CMS for content management, Stripe for payment processing, and React-Hook-Form for form handling.

5. The project implements a custom order management system with a provider pattern for state management.

6. The application uses server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance.

7. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with custom utility classes defined in the project.
